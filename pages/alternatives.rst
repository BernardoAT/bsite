bpython isn't the only alternative Python shell. Each project has its own goals and values, so you may find bpython isn't the right tool for your needs. We know for sure that some people prefer IPython to bpython, so we think it's a good idea to make sure you're aware of other tools available.

If you know of any others please let us know. And if you're the author of any of the listed projects and would like to add a brief description to the page feel free to get in touch.
